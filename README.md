# Factorial-Finder
The factorial of a positive integer n is defined as the product of the sequence , n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of 0 is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion. 

## Description

The factorial of a positive integer n is defined as the product of the sequence , n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of 0 is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion. The program is a static command line program to find the factorial values of numbers for some given number of inputs.
